# Is Bitcoin Good?
If you trust people who think bitcoin is going to be the new type of money they tend to sell bitcoin as a really useful amazing new technology that will bring prosperity and freedom. When I've looked into these claims I've found that they at least on the surface seem to make a decent amount of sense. However there are still big question marks for me. It does not seem far fetched to me that bitcoin may be really bad if some of the core assumptions that bitcoiners make are incorrect, as an example it's a currency with a hard limit on how many tokens there are: exactly 21 million bitcoin will ever exist.

# Why bitcoin?
The claim that I'm most interested in is that there is a huge systematic problem with regular fiat currency and the current banking system. The claim goes on and says that this issue is fundamental to how modern money works and that basically the only solutions are gold and certain cryptocurrencies. Among cryptocurrencies these it seems bitcoin is the one that's fundamentally oriented to solve the money problems (and only the money problems).

# What is the blog structure?
In this blog I'll try to de-tangle and describe my thoughts about the different areas of bitcoin and arguments for and against it.
I hope this blog has an end to it where I conclude what I think about bitcoin once and for all. After that perhaps I'll update the blog sometimes in order to address potential new arguments, hopefully though the blog will have exhaustively analysed the big arguments for and against bitcoin by then though.

The fundamental goal of the blog is truth, I want to know what is real, if bitcoin is good I want to know it, if it's not good then I want to know it. I will try to be as intellectually honest as I can in my analysis.

# What is the basic case for bitcoin?
The two fundamental features of bitcoin that advocates point to are the freedom of money and the economic efficiency of 'hard' money.
## Freedom of Money
Freedom of money essentially means that you have control over your own money and can do with it how you choose. This mirrors how physical money works, if you have cash in your wallet that cash is essentially only under your control, barring someone physically coming up and stealing it. If you have money in your bank account the same is no longer true. If someone influences your bank to freeze your bank account or to only allow you to spend money on certain things then there is nothing you can do about it. That money is ultimately controlled by your bank.
The reasons for why freedom in money is said to be good vary a lot, some reasons are more ideological and some more practical. What follows is a non-exhaustive list.
- Personal freedom is an inherent good
- What you spend money on is entirely up to you
- Transferring money internationally is simple
- Protection against government or bank seizure
- Immunity to money printing
- Potentially private transactions\*

\*This is a nuanced issue, bitcoin is both very non-private and potentially quite private
## Economic Efficiency
The second group of reasons that advocates like bitcoin is because it is so called 'hard' money as opposed to 'easy' money. Hard in this context refers to the difficulty to create new bitcoins, in fact bitcoin is the hardest possible money there is since only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist.
This is purported to be a good thing because it prevents the debasement of the money which allows holders to avoid having their money indirectly seized through inflation and makes the money attractive a way to save your wealth, otherwise called a store of value.

# What are the basic cases against bitcoin?
The cases for why bitcoin is fundamentally bad at being money generally group into 4 categories. Too much control of money is bad, economically it's bad, technologically bitcoin is inferior, and it consumes too much electricity.
## People controlling their money too much is bad
Bitcoin detractors may say that people having too much personal control over their money ends up being a bad thing. It leads to an increased ability to perform criminal activities such as tax evasion, money laundering, buying illegal goods, funding terrorism. It is therefore important for the government to be able to seize the money of the population.
## Economically it is bad
Bitcoin detractors may argue that not having control over the money supply makes the government and central bank less able to manage recessions by changing interest rates, and therefore 'hard' money is a bad thing for modern economies.
They may also claim that lending money becomes much more risky and expensive in a world with a 'hard' currency and lending is a critical part of the economy.
## Technologically it is bad
Bitcoin detractors may argue that bitcoin is an early version of the blockchain technology and is relatively primitive compared to more modern crypto-currencies like Ethereum, Ada and others.
Some may even argue that blockchain technology in general is bad in order to solve the problem of money.
## Environmentally it is bad
Bitcoin detracts may argue that the amount of electricity bitcoin consumes for its proof-of-work mining is too much, wasteful and damaging to the environment.
# Is bitcoin going to be used?
When trying to figure out if bitcoin is good an essential part is if it's actually viable for whatever use-case it is good for. Viability and practical success is necessary for it to be either good or bad, else it is irrelevant.
## How is it useful for users?
The purported utilities from an individual point of view is many-fold. In the short term it is meant as a speculative investment opportunity that yields high returns. In the long term it is meant to serve as a safe and stable store of value. On top of that it is meant to serve as a libre and easy payment system that works over the internet.

# This is just the beginning
The above topics are complicated and there are many nuances and additional topics that have not been mentioned. My hope is that this blog can deal with each topic systematically, fairly, and thoroughly. On top of that I'd like this blog to essentially have an end where we actually answer the question 'is bitcoin good?' with the appropriate amount of nuance necessary, such as giving the assumptions and trade-offs underpinning each answer.

In this project I aim to be as fair and objective as I can. At the end of the day I am actually interested in getting a truthful answer to the question.

I welcome contributions to this blog and I will manage that through [github](https://github.com/isbitcoingood/isbitcoingood). Hopefully it can have a structure a bit like Wikipedia, but with the sole focus of answering this one question.
